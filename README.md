Here is my advice: follow the guidelines below to insure a successful and effective learning experience. Exciting times ahead for us all
 
** Read the Announcements on the Course Page
** Check email regularly

** Know the Course Syllabus and Calendar

** Do the Assigned Readings in the Class Lectures and Library Readings. Do so early in the week to prepare yourself for the discussions and assignments. Knowledge is Power and, these days, Job Security!

** Post to the Discussion Topics (Post on or before Tuesday). Since the class is time sensitive, posting early will allow you and your classmates to view each other's responses and promote more fruitful and pertinent discussions. That's what collaborative learning is all about. Always reply and reply often with substantive comments with your thoughts and experiences on the course material. This will not only offer the class an opportunity to learn from your valuable experiences and thoughts, you will learn from theirs. You must post at least three replies. One answer to the discussion question and at least two replies to your classmates.

** Complete the Course Project Assignments Read the class lectures, announcements and assignment descriptions in the Lessons. Review the videos and links posted in the Announcements throughout all weeks. Review assignments early in the week so if you have questions, you can get them answered before assignments are due.

Being that this is an online environment it is important that you take advantage of the discussions and student lounge to get to know your fellow classmates and the course material. Also, explore and use all the resources available to you. There are great ones available for your pleasure and will offer you a more sound understanding of the material. 
If you ** attend class regularly ** and ** participate often ** you ** increase your chances of success. ** You will ** learn valuable information every time. ** Just make sure to keep your responses on target and with academic and social soundness. If you are ever in doubt on how your response may be interpreted or that it may be offensive, please feel free to email me before posting.

Another issue that you need to be aware of is ** Time Management **. Do not wait until the last moment. This is an accelerated course. Plan your work and stay ahead. That way you will have time to revise your work, spell check and reread it before handing it in or posting it.

The more time you put into your learning the more you will get out of it. Be sure to set aside routine time every day for your class. This is really the best way to insure your optimal success. I talk from experience.
Don't be afraid to ask questions.
